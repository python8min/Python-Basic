# Python Basics: Variables and the `print()` Function

Welcome to the **Python Basics** section! This part of the course will teach you how to define variables and use the `print()` function to display output in Python. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of:

1. **What variables are**
2. **How to create and use variables**
3. **The purpose of the `print()` function**
4. **Practical examples to solidify your learning**

## 📚 What Are Variables?

A variable is a container for storing data. Think of it as a labeled box where you can put your data and retrieve it whenever you need. 

### Key Characteristics:
- A variable has a **name** (identifier).
- It stores **values** (data).
- You can **reuse** and **modify** variables as needed.

## ✍️ How to Create a Variable

In Python, you don't need to declare the type of variable explicitly. Just assign a value to a name using the `=` operator:

```python
# Syntax
variable_name = value

# Examples
x = 10           # An integer variable
# x : int = 10
y = 3.14         # A floating-point variable
# y :float= 3.14         # A floating-point variable
name = "Alice"   # A string variable
# name : str = "Alice"
name_1 = 'Alice' # is the same as
is_active = True # A boolean variable
```

### Rules for Variable Names:
1. Must start with a **letter** (A-Z or a-z) or an **underscore** (_).
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Can only contain **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores**.
4. Are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different).

Invalid examples:
```python
2x = 5     # ❌ Variable name cannot start with a number
my-var = 8 # ❌ Hyphens are not allowed
```

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

```python
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

```
### Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
```python
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

### Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
type(x)

```

## 📤 The `print()` Function

The `print()` function is used to display output on the screen.

### Syntax:
```python
print(object1, object2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n')
```

- **object1, object2, ...**: The objects to be printed.
- **sep**: Separator between the objects (default is a space).
- **end**: String to be appended after the last object (default is a newline).

### Examples:
```python
# Printing a single value
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!

# Printing multiple values
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)  # Output: Name: Alice Age: 25

# Using custom separator and ending
print("Python", "is", "fun", sep="-", end="!")  # Output: Python-is-fun!
```

## 💻 Combining Variables and `print()`

Here’s how you can use variables with the `print()` function:

### Example 1: Simple Variable Display
```python
# Define variables
x = 10
y = 20

# Print variables
print("The value of x is:", x)  # Output: The value of x is: 10
print("The value of y is:", y)  # Output: The value of y is: 20
```

### Example 2: Performing Operations
```python
# Define variables
a = 5
b = 7

# Perform arithmetic and print the result
result = a + b
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is:", result)  # Output: The sum of 5 and 7 is: 12
```

### Example 3: Updating Variables
```python
# Define a variable
counter = 0

# Update the variable
counter += 1  # Equivalent to counter = counter + 1

# Print the updated value
print("Updated counter value:", counter)  # Output: Updated counter value: 1
```

## ✨ Advanced Printing Techniques

### f-Strings (Formatted Strings)
An elegant way to include variables in a string:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

### Multiline Strings
```python
message = """This is a 
multiline string"""
print(message)
# Output:
# This is a 
# multiline string
```

---

### Print Format & position
```python
s : str = 'Hello'

print(f'{s:^20} :')  # set center & 20 scpace
print(f'{s:>20} :')  # Right & 20 scpace
print(f'{s:<20} :')  # left & 20 scpace
print(f'{s:|<20} :') # Right & 20 |
print(f'{s:*^20} :') # set center & 20 |
```

```python
x : int = 25000000

print(f'{x:,} ')   # separate by comma      
print(f'{ 2545 + x = } ') # Calculate
print(f'{x: %.2f} ') 
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Practice Problems

1. Create a variable called `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello"`. Use `print()` to display its value.
2. Define two variables, `num1` and `num2`, with values 15 and 30. Calculate their sum and print the result.
3. Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a message like:
   ```
   Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old.
   ```
